> **DISCLAIMER**: This code was generated by an AI assistant. It is provided solely as a technical reference to demonstrate the integration of the Python programming language with the Pygame library. It serves as a proof of concept for the required tools and APIs but does not represent a final commercial product.

## 1. Project Overview
This repository contains a functional 2D Aim Trainer game. The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate that the selected development tools (Python and Pygame) work together correctly on the target operating system.

The application implements a standard "Game Loop" architecture, featuring:
* **State Management**: Transitions between Menu, Gameplay, and Game Over states.
* **Event Handling**: Processing mouse clicks and quit events.
* **Rendering**: Drawing geometric primitives and text to the screen.
* **Game Logic**: Collision detection (target hits), scoring, and timers.

## 2. Public Repository

## 3. Environment Requirements
To compile and run this project, the following environment is required:

* **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS 12+ (Monterey/Ventura/Sonoma), or modern Linux distributions (Ubuntu 20.04+).
* **Interpreter/Compiler**: Python 3.10 or higher.
* **Library**: Pygame 2.5.0 or higher.

## 4. Installation & Build Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the development environment and run the code.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
git clone [INSERT YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY LINK HERE]
cd [YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME]
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
It is best practice to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

* **Windows**:
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

* **MacOS/Linux**:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required Pygame library using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, execute the main script:
```bash
python aim_trainer.py
```
