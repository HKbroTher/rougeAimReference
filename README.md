> **DISCLAIMER**: This code was generated by an AI assistant. It is provided solely as a technical reference to demonstrate the integration of the Python programming language with the Pygame library. It does not represent the final product.

## 1. Project Overview
This repository contains a 2D aim training application. It demonstrates the basic "Game Loop" architecture, event handling (mouse clicks), rendering 2D primitives, and state management (Menu -> Playing -> Game Over) using the Pygame framework.

## 2. Technical Stack
The following tools are required to compile and run this project:

* **Language**: Python 3.10 or higher.
* **Library**: Pygame (v2.0+).
* **OS**: Tested on Windows 10/11 and macOS Sequoia.

## 3. Setup and Execution Instructions
Follow these steps to build and run the code on your local machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_LINK_HERE>
cd <YOUR_REPOSITORY_FOLDER_NAME>
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
It is best practice to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

* **Windows**:
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

* **MacOS/Linux**:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required Pygame library using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, execute the main script:
```bash
python aim_trainer.py
```
